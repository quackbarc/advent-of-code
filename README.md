Homemade[^1] solutions and tools for solving the annual programmer's Hannukah that people call the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

## Solutions and branches

Most of my solutions are on separate branches! This list below might not be very up-to-date, so check the branches tab if you really wanna check that out.

- [master](../../tree/master), for the base tools I use for the marathon.
- [2023-advent](../../tree/2023-advent), for 2023's series of challenges.

[^1]: Almost all of the time at least. It's all me unless I specify a comment somewhere saying otherwise.
